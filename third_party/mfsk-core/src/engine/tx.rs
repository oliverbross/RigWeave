//! Protocol-generic transmit-side helpers: message bits → tone sequence.
//!
//! The tone sequence assembly (slot Costas arrays into their positions, map
//! LDPC codeword bits into per-symbol Gray-coded tone indices) is protocol-
//! agnostic given [`Protocol`]: iterate `SYNC_BLOCKS` and fill each data
//! chunk between consecutive blocks with `chunk_len × BITS_PER_SYMBOL` bits.
//!
//! GFSK waveform synthesis lives in [`super::dsp::gfsk`] — the `tones_to_*`
//! helpers there consume the output of this module.
