//! Coarse (frequency, time) sync search.
//!
//! Scans a grid of candidate alignments and ranks them by how well the
//! per-symbol tone powers match the known WSPR sync vector. Candidates
//! above a threshold are handed to the Fano decoder one by one; the
//! first one that unpacks to a plausible message wins.
//!
//! ## Strategy
//!
//! 1. Step the starting sample in **quarter-symbol** increments (NSPS/4).
//!    At 12 kHz that's 2048 samples = ~171 ms — enough resolution for
//!    WSPR's 683 ms symbol window without going quadratic.
//! 2. Step the base frequency in **one-bin** increments (`tone_spacing`
//!    = 1.4648 Hz at 12 kHz). Finer than that buys nothing with the
//!    single-symbol FFT we use downstream.
//! 3. For each (t, f), compute `sync_score` (see [`super::rx`]); keep
//!    the top N.
//! 4. Return candidates sorted by score descending.
//!
//! A future refinement will promote top-K candidates to a fine search
//! (sub-bin freq + sub-quarter-symbol time via parabolic interpolation
//! on the score grid). Not required for typical crowded-band decoding.
