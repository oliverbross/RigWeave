//! Q65 distributed sync pattern.

//! Q65 transmits 22 sync symbols (always tone 0) at fixed positions
//! across the 85-symbol frame; the remaining 63 positions carry the
//! channel symbols of the QRA codeword (offset by +1 — Q65 symbol
//! value `s` is sent on tone `s + 1`, since tone 0 is reserved for
//! sync).
//!
//! The sync vector below is the 1-indexed `isync(22)` array from
//! WSJT-X `lib/qra/q65/q65.f90` (line ~10), translated to 0-indexed
//! positions.
