//! Burned-in station identification for SSTV transmit — the ID plate.
//!
//! ⚠️ THIS IS A COMPLIANCE FEATURE, NOT DECORATION. Before it, an SSTV over
//! carried **no station identification of any kind**: no burned-in overlay
//! (`SstvView.tsx` was `drawImage` only), no CW ident (`cw_id_after_73` sets
//! `pending_cw_id` in the FT/digital QSO state machine alone, and
//! `Engine::sstv_send` never touched it), and the FSK ID is decode-only — no
//! encoder exists. One SSTV over is a single continuous PTT hold of up to
//! ≈290 s (PD-290) of picture-only audio.
//!
//! §97.119(b)(4) lets the call go out "by an image emission conforming to the
//! applicable transmission standards … when all or part of the communications
//! are transmitted in the same image emission" — the picture *is* the
//! communication, so a call burned into the raster is the ident. But it only
//! counts if it **survives the raster it is drawn into**. A call that is present
//! in the source bitmap and smeared into illegibility by the mode is not an
//! identification. That is what the geometry below is for, and
//! `tests/id_legibility.rs` is the evidence.
//!
//! ## Why a bitmap font and not the webview's `fillText`
//!
//! Our own demod (`crate::demod`) takes an FFT **every sample**
//! (`PIXEL_FFT_STRIDE = 1`) through an SNR-adaptive Hann window drawn from
//! `HANN_LENS = [12, 16, 24, 32, 64, 128, 256]` at the 11 025 Hz working rate —
//! ≥20 dB picks 12 samples, ≥10 dB picks 16. One decoded pixel is one sample's
//! estimate, so the effective horizontal support of a pixel is the **window
//! length**, not the pixel period. In picture-width terms that is a smear of
//! ≈0.4 % (Scottie DX) to ≈2.0 % (Martin 2 at 10 dB). Vertically there is no
//! such integration — lines are demodulated independently, and every one of the
//! 15 modes carries one luma (or one full RGB triple) per image row. **The
//! raster punishes horizontal detail and colour detail; it does not punish
//! vertical detail.**
//!
//! Three rulings fall out of that:
//!
//! 1. **Stroke width is the binding constraint, not glyph height.** A vertical
//!    stroke narrower than the demod window smears toward the background. So the
//!    stroke is sized as a fraction of picture width ([`ID_STROKE_FRACTION`]),
//!    which travels across all five rasters instead of being tuned for one.
//! 2. **The ID must be a luminance feature.** `tone::lum_to_freq` maps 0 → 1500 Hz
//!    and 255 → 2300 Hz: black-to-white is the *entire* 800 Hz deviation. Colour
//!    cannot carry it — PD averages chroma across row pairs (`encode_pd`),
//!    Robot 24/36 send one chroma component per radio line and duplicate it
//!    (`encode_robot`), and Scottie/Martin sample R, G and B at different times
//!    within the line, so vertical edges fringe. A **monochrome** plate is exactly
//!    neutral chroma (Cr = Cb = 128 for both black and white), so every one of
//!    those subsampling schemes is lossless over it — the one region of the frame
//!    where chroma handling costs nothing.
//! 3. **An outline does not work at this size.** A 1 px halo is a fraction of the
//!    smear and vanishes; an outline thick enough to survive *is* a plate. So:
//!    white glyphs on a solid black plate, which is also the maximum deviation the
//!    mode offers and makes the ID independent of the picture behind it.
//!
//! And because vertical resolution is exact while horizontal is not, the glyphs
//! are scaled **anisotropically** — [`ID_STROKE_FRACTION`] sets the horizontal
//! scale, and the vertical scale is half of it. That spends pixels on the axis
//! that needs them and gives back roughly half the frame height the plate would
//! otherwise eat.
//!
//! `fillText` could satisfy none of this: at 320 px wide a readable point size
//! lays down ~1.3 px antialiased strokes, and its glyph shapes vary by platform —
//! unacceptable in the one feature whose entire purpose is being readable. A
//! bitmap font at integer scale makes stroke width an exact, chosen number, costs
//! ~270 bytes, and adds no dependency.
//!
//! ## Who draws it
//!
//! **This module is the authority.** `sstv_send` (src-tauri) burns the plate into
//! the operator's RGB *after* validating the geometry and *before* handing it to
//! the encoder, so no webview bug, stale buffer or third-party caller can put an
//! unidentified picture on the air. `ui/src/sstvIdOverlay.ts` mirrors the table
//! and the geometry so the operator's preview is what actually goes out (the two
//! draw identical pixels, so the double draw is a no-op); `ui/src/sstv-id-overlay.test.ts`
//! parses THIS file and fails if the mirror drifts.
