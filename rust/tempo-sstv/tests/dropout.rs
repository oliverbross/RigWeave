//! A picture must survive losing the signal in the middle of it.
//!
//! **Origin.** On 2026-08-05/06 the decoder gained a second way out of
//! its `Decoding` state: an end-of-transmission trigger that fired once
//! no sync pulse had been heard for three line periods. It made a
//! truncated picture emit sooner, and it broke normal reception, because
//! *a carrier that stopped and a carrier momentarily lost are the same
//! observation*. Measured on the commit that shipped it, against the
//! commit before (`78ac6092`):
//!
//! | input | before | with the trigger |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Robot 36, 0.6 s fade at 50 % | one image, 240 rows | one image, **120 rows** |
//! | Robot 72, 0.95 s fade at 50 % | one image, 240 rows | **two images**, 120 + 111 rows |
//! | Scottie 1, 4 s QSB null at 40 % | one image, 256 rows | **two images**, 102 + 145 rows |
//! | PD-120, 6 s QSB null at 40 % | one image, 496 rows | **two images**, 200 + 274 rows |
//!
//! Three line periods is 0.45 s on Robot 36 and 0.9 s on Robot 72, so on
//! those modes a *sub-second* dropout was enough. The trigger was
//! reverted on 2026-08-06 and this file is what stops it, or anything
//! shaped like it, coming back. A split picture is worse than a late one.
//!
//! **What is asserted.** For a COMPLETE, VIS-anchored transmission with
//! the signal interrupted mid-picture, the decoder must emit exactly
//! **one** `ImageComplete`, `partial: false`, carrying the whole frame —
//! the rows over the interruption are demodulated from whatever was
//! there, which is the honest outcome and the one every previous release
//! produced. The interruptions cover what a receiver actually delivers:
//! band noise (a fade), digital silence (a hard mute or a squelched
//! receiver), a multi-second QSB null, and another station's SSB/CW
//! landing on the frequency.
//!
//! The last test states the other half — a transmission that genuinely
//! stops early still decodes, as a whole frame with a noise tail — so
//! that "we lose nothing by having no end-of-transmission trigger" is a
//! fact in the suite rather than a claim in a commit message.
