//! Negative real-radio regression — [`tempo_sstv::SstvDecoder`] must not
//! false-positive on non-SSTV audio.
//!
//! **Origin.** An ISS Zarya capture on 2026-05-04 22:38:27 UTC turned
//! out to carry no SSTV (Zarya transmits SSTV only during ARISS-
//! scheduled events). 0 VIS codes detected on the 25-minute recording;
//! a separate spectrum check confirmed the audio sat in the 247–563 Hz
//! band with no energy in SSTV's 1500–2300 Hz pixel band. We could not
//! commit the recording itself (`/tests/fixtures` is gitignored per the
//! project's "no third-party-licensed fixtures in the repo" convention,
//! and the redistribution-license story for community-shared captures
//! is unclear), so the regression coverage is reproduced with two
//! synthetic non-SSTV audio buffers: white noise at the Zarya
//! recording's measured RMS level (~0.3), and pure silence.
//!
//! Both must produce zero `SstvEvent::ImageComplete` events of ANY kind
//! **and no lock**, without panicking. This is the no-signal counterpart
//! to the synthetic round-trip suite in `tests/roundtrip.rs` — both must
//! hold for any release.
//!
//! **Tightened 2026-08-06, and it stays tightened.** The filter used to
//! be `ImageComplete { partial: false, .. }`, with `partial: false` as a
//! *literal sub-pattern* — so an `ImageComplete { partial: true }` did
//! not match, was not counted, and left both assertions green. That was
//! a hole exactly where this file's purpose lies: a decoder that
//! hallucinated a picture out of the Zarya noise and stamped it
//! `partial: true` would have passed the test that exists *because of
//! that incident*. Counting every `ImageComplete` still left one more
//! thing unsaid — a decoder that announced a lock and then never emitted
//! an image would also have passed — so the guard now requires the event
//! stream to be **empty**, the same bar `tests/nexus_acceptance.rs`
//! holds noise to.
//!
//! Both forms of the hole were found while a no-VIS ("blind") decode
//! path was being written; that path was reverted on 2026-08-06 as
//! unsound. The guard is kept in its strict form regardless. It is a
//! better statement of what this file means — *this audio is not a
//! picture, and nothing about it may be reported as one* — it costs
//! nothing, and it holds whether or not anything ever tries to decode
//! without a header again.
