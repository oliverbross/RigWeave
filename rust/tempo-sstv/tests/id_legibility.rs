//! ⭐ THE BURNED-IN CALLSIGN IS READ BACK OFF THE AIR, NOT ASSUMED.
//!
//! An SSTV over is one continuous PTT hold of up to ≈290 s carrying nothing but
//! picture. §97.119(b)(4) lets the station ident ride in that picture — but only
//! if the receiving station can actually read it. A callsign that is present in
//! the source bitmap and smeared into illegibility by the mode's demodulator is
//! not an identification, and no amount of asserting that `draw_id` was called
//! would show the difference.
//!
//! So this test does the whole loop, for all 15 shipped modes:
//!
//! 1. Rasterize a **hostile** picture — half near-white (240), half near-black
//!    (16), a saturated colour wash, and a mid-grey band behind the plate — then
//!    burn the ID in with the production [`tempo_sstv::draw_id`].
//! 2. Encode with the production [`tempo_sstv::encode_image`] at 12 kHz, the rate
//!    `sstv_send` uses.
//! 3. Optionally add seeded AWGN at a stated SNR (a fixed xorshift, so the noisy
//!    cases are asserted rather than "reported").
//! 4. Decode with the real [`tempo_sstv::SstvDecoder`] — VIS auto-detect, the
//!    SNR-adaptive Hann window bank, per-line demod, `ImageComplete`.
//! 5. **Read the call back out of the decoded pixels**: register on the plate,
//!    threshold, correlate each character cell against all 39 glyph bitmaps,
//!    argmax. Assert the joined string is the callsign.
//! 6. Assert a **contrast margin** as well: mean decoded luma over glyph pixels
//!    minus mean over plate-background pixels. The argmax says a matched filter
//!    can read it; the margin is the proxy for a human reading it. They fail for
//!    different reasons, which is why both are here.
//!
//! ## Why step 5 registers instead of indexing
//!
//! Because the decoder's own line alignment moves under noise, and that is not
//! what this test is about. Measured (PD-50, 20 dB, seed `0x5EED…0001`): the whole
//! decoded picture came back offset **+8 px horizontally** at the shipped
//! geometry, with content rolling in from the previous line — mean |ΔLuma| 19.3
//! against 12.6 at 10 dB and 3.9 clean. Note the direction of that: MORE noise
//! decoded straighter, so this is a sync-lock artifact rather than a smooth
//! degradation. Across the whole `sx_sweep` the offsets run −3 to +20 px and are
//! **horizontal only** — every measured `dy` was 0, which is what the physics
//! predicts, since lines demodulate independently.
//!
//! The *picture* moves, plate and all. A read-back that indexed the nominal plate
//! rectangle would call that an illegible ID when what actually happened is a
//! sync offset in the RX path that a human looking at the received picture would
//! not even notice. So the read-back finds the plate the way a receiving operator
//! does — by looking for it — and then judges only the glyphs.
//!
//! Registration uses the plate's **rectangle** (a black bar of known size against
//! the band behind it), never its letters, so it cannot manufacture a correct
//! read. Two things hold that claim up: with no plate drawn at all this file
//! printed `"      "` for every mode (the state of the world before `draw_id` had
//! a body), and `a_picture_with_no_plate_does_not_read_back_as_a_callsign` keeps
//! it that way.
//!
//! What this does NOT prove: that a *third-party* decoder (MMSSTV, QSSTV, Black
//! Cat, RX-SSTV) reads it. Our demod window bank is slowrx's, which is
//! representative, and the geometry is a fraction of picture width so it travels
//! — but the only proof of the far end is an on-air test, which is the operator's
//! to run.
